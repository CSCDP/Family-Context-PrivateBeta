# **Social Finance Digital Labs - Family Context Private Beta**

## Background

The Family Context project has been in the works since June 2018. It is the result of a cross-council collaboration aiming to solve some of the most entrenched problems faced by children’s social services. The primary goal of this collaborative effort is to improve outcomes for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. 

## Problem

When social workers first interact with a family, they do not have easy access to key information on relevant people in the family and the services that have engaged with them. This results in them either taking decisions without this **key information** or spending a **significant amount of time searching for it**.

The consequences are that social workers...
   
  …sometimes have **incomplete information** which can change decisions and outcomes for children and families.
   
  …**waste time** chasing information, which they would prefer to spend with the family on working out a plan.
